                    Cristiano Ronaldo: Juventus forward recovers from coronavirus

                    Ronaldo, who tested positive while on international duty with Portugal, is free to come 
                     out of self-isolation making him available for Juventus' Serie A match at Spezia on 
                     Sunday; Portugal international missed Wednesday's Champions League Group G 
                     defeat to Lionel Messi's Barcelona 
                <b>
                    Cristiano Ronaldo has fully recovered from coronavirus, 19 days 
                     after initially testing positive for the disease.
                </b>
                    The Juventus forward, 35, initially returned a positive test while on 
                     international duty with Portugal earlier this month.  
                    Juventus were without the five-time Ballon d'Or winner for their  
                     previous four matches, including Wednesday's Champions League  
                     Group G defeat to Barcelona, winning just once in that time. 
                    But the former Real Madrid and Manchester United forward is  
                     available once again as Juventus resume their Serie A campaign at  
                     Spezia on Sunday.

                <p class="p2">
                    The statement from Juventus read: "Cristiano Ronaldo carried out a 
                     check with a diagnostic test (swab) for Covid 19.
                    "The exam provided a negative result. The player has, therefore,
                     recovered after 19 days and is no longer subjected to home 
                     isolation."
                    There was a big build-up surrounding Ronaldo's potential reunion 
                     with Barcelona's Lionel Messi, but the forward's prolonged bout of 
                     coronavirus delayed two of football's best-ever players meeting 
                     again.
